how does tandem work:

Tandem language learning is based on communication between two people.  Traditionaly this is done face to face and pre-scheduled time and place.  Together tandem partners will choose how they wish to participate, what topics to discuss, how much of each language will be used, if and when language switches should occur, etc.  It is important to have shared interests, plenty of topics to discuss, and a healthy sense of curiousity.  The primary goals are typically to explore and learn another culture, meet new people, and learn how to express yourself in another language.

Most tandem apps today focus on providing a network to bring two people together, which is great.  But this app tries to fill in the gaps for when a tandem partner is not available, or when your schedule is not condusive to regular meetings.  Or, hey, simply if you just don't want to meet with real people.  I mean, it's 2016, we're not robophobic.

promote question audio recording:

Do you want to practice your pronunciation without having to answer strange questions all the time.  Try recording some questions!  Your recordings can be used in other tandem session (replacing the text-to-speech), which will help other language learners get used to hearing and understanding REAL people speaking. This method also quickly gets feedback from both native speakers and other language learners.  Just click on the questions link, select a question and follow the instructions.  And don't worry, you'll have plenty of options for do-overs and we won't use any audio that you don't save.

to promote scheduling:

One of the most important aspects for successful tandem learning is regular practice. This helps learners to become familiar with the foreign language more quickly, increases learning frequency, and makes sure that they get plenty of practice.
